Ditaa-live
==========

[Ditaa](http://ditaa.sourceforge.net/) is command-line utility written in
Java, that can convert diagrams drawn using ascii art into proper bitmap
graphics. Ditaa-live is a golang web server that show the generated images
from ditaa. But the most important thing is that the image is automatically
reloaded when the ditaa file is modified. It works by opening a websocket
connection to the server that will monitor the file with inotify (Linux-only).

**Note**: ditaa-live only works in a browser that supports WebSocket,
i.e. Chrome or Firefox (version 11.0 at least).


How to use it?
--------------

Install golang-weekly (2012-02-07) and don't forget to set `$GOROOT`.
And then, run these instructions:

    git clone git://github.com/nono/ditaa-live.git
    cd ditaa-live
    go get code.google.com/p/go.net/websocket
    go build -o bin/ditaa-live *.go
    ./bin/ditaa-live tests
    chromium-browser http://127.0.0.1:4444/


TODO
----

* Add a minimal CSS
* Fix it in Firefox 10 (use MozWebSocket instead of WebSocket)
